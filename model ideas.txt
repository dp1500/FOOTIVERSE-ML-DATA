another column for home and away side can be mindset
i.e was the team defensive, balanced or attacking.

this can be implemented by looking at teams of each season adn implying what mindset they might have used and their opponents. also mindset will change based on opponent
like west ham may play attacking against norwich but may play defensive against mancity

also encoding should be done with order def = 0 , balanced = 1, attack = 2
